#Training ground

I made this repository to keep track of all the little scripts I made while going through [*"JAVASCRIPT & JQUERY"*](http://javascriptbook.com/) by **Jon Duckett**.

I used [*Jade*](https://pugjs.org) (now pug) and [*Sass*](http://sass-lang.com/) along with *JavaScript* to make these scripts.

I'll update this as I progress through the book.

As of now, I finished the basic part and made *12 scripts* :
  1. A price updater based on user input
  2. A simple order check table
  3. A really simple message updater function
  4. A size calculator
  5. A temperature converter with + and - buttons, background changes based on temperature (*contains also a kilometers/miles object which is not finished*)
  6. A really simple content updater using **constructor**
  7. A script using the **Window object** to get some infos
  8. A script using the **Document object** to get some infos
  9. A script using the **String global object** to manipulate some text
  10. A script using the **Number & Math global object** to manipulate some numbers
  11. A greeting message depending of the hour of the day, a message with today's date, a simple clock, a day/hour counter from a fixed date, an hour counter to a fixed date... (aka playing with the **Date global object**)
  12. A simple script using **for loop** to go through an array

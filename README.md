#Training ground

I made this repository to keep track of all the little scripts I made while going through [*"JAVASCRIPT & JQUERY"*](http://javascriptbook.com/) by **Jon Duckett**.

I used [*Jade*](https://pugjs.org) (now pug) and [*Sass*](http://sass-lang.com/) along with *JavaScript* to make these scripts.

I'll update this as I progress through the book.

As of now, I finished the basic and intermediary part which you can check on [https://fabiendeborde.github.io/Working-on-JavaScript/Base/](https://fabiendeborde.github.io/Working-on-JavaScript/Base/).<br/>
and [https://fabiendeborde.github.io/Working-on-JavaScript/Intermediary/](https://fabiendeborde.github.io/Working-on-JavaScript/Intermediary/).<br/>

I made *12 scripts*:

  // Basic ones
  1. A price updater based on user input
  2. A simple order check table
  3. A really simple message updater function
  4. A size calculator
  5. A temperature converter with + and - buttons, background changes based on temperature (*contains also a kilometers/miles object which is not finished*)
  6. A really simple content updater using **constructors**
  7. A script using the **Window object** to get some infos
  8. A script using the **Document object** to get some infos
  9. A script using the **String global object** to manipulate some text
  10. A script using the **Number & Math global object** to manipulate some numbers
  11. A greeting message depending of the hour of the day, a message with today's date, a simple clock, a day/hour counter from a fixed date, an hour counter to a fixed date... (aka playing with the **Date global object**)
  12. A simple script using **for loop** to go through an array

  // Intermediary ones
  13. Multiple ways to target elements, manipulate and traverse the DOM
  14. Multiple ways to use event hanlders and listeners and their fallback for IE8 and older
  15. A script using event delegation to remove list items from an unordered list
  16. A script to get the user at the bottom of the page (without using anchor)
  17. A script using focus and blur event to give hints to a user filling an input element
  18. A modal window using the click event to get removed
  19. A navigation bar giving the position of the cursor relative to the screen, the browser and the document (using mousemove event)
  20. A canvas changing color with the cursor position in it and displaying the rgb value (using mousemove event)
  21. Using the keyboard event to display the characters left and the last character entered in a textarea
  22. A light form validation (checkbox checked) and custom message based on the option selected in the dropdown menu (using the form event)
